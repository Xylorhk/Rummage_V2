Great job finding that object! Just as I suspected, the magnet's polarity must've interfered 
with that there cloaking device and made us all go invisible!~
Don't worry, if my calculations are correct, that device shouldn't malfunction anymore. 
In fact, I think it might have the opposite effect now!~
Hmm... Yes! You should be able to see invisible objects with that device now! That should include my 
fellow worker bots!~
If only there was some device to overcharge our camo plating and reset it though...
