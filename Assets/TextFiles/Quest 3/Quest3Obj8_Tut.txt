Wow! Ask and ye shall receive! I've got my leg back!~
Just in time too, I got this door behind me open finally. You see, when the 
power surge struck, my fellow worker bots kind of freaked out...~
They locked themselves in this section of the yard and they seem to have lost themselves in 
the process. You know, being invisible and all.~
If you can find all of them and overcharge their camo plating, we should be able to fully 
operate Mr. Crane again!~
Good luck Sir Junker Droid.
