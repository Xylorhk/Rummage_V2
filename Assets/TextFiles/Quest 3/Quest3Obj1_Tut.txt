Hello young Junker Droid, what brings you to these parts? What's that? You want to help 
fix the Sorting Yard?~
Well, good luck with that. I'm sure you've noticed that I seem to be standing on 
one leg at the moment. That ain't no optical illusion.~
No, ya see, all of us bots have camouflage plating built into our systems. One day 
the workers felt a surge of some kind and now we're all out of wack!~
I need you to climb this here crane to my right, but first, you'll need to find one of the old 
Grabbers we have laying around and fix it up. Return to me once you do so.
